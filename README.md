While JBoss AS provides a convenient JNDI View as part of its admin console, Glassfish v3 shipped without one. This is why I wrote this little utility.

This is a small Web application that can be deployed on any JavaEE application server that provides a navigable view of the application server's JNDI namespace.

Currently at version 0.2, which has been used successfully on Glassfish 3.1.x.
